HOA Annual Meeting Update (September 23, 2024)
The Forest Trails HOA recently held its annual meeting and elected new officers: Kate Peacock as President, Kristin Roy as Vice President, and Scott Miller as Treasurer. The remaining board members will stay in their current roles.

Website Update
Scott Miller will also be overseeing improvements to the HOA website, which has been relocated to a new domain: fthoa.info. The upgrades will include enhanced administrative controls and a more modern appearance.

ACC (Architectural Control Committee)
The ACC is actively responding to homeowner inquiries. Homeowners are reminded to submit forms for any exterior changes for approval. No major concerns were raised, but discussions included updating roof standards, driveway changes (excluding asphalt), and future consideration for solar installations in line with state mandates.

Financial Update
The budget remains stable with no dues increase this year, staying at $100. However, a new reserve study will be conducted due to inflation.

Other Discussions
Several topics were discussed, including potential property audits for compliance (specifically regarding RVs and boats), organizing a community garage sale, and concerns over maintenance of the retention pond and surrounding areas.
